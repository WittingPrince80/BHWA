<h1>What Are Black Holes?</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Universe is one giant cosmosmos of stars, galaxys and planets, but most of the Universe is made dark matter and whats somthing else thats dark? Black Holes.A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>
